## Steps to play the game : 

- Player 1 is assigned the key 'X' and Player 2 is assigned the key '0'.

- The game starts with an empty board.

- Players are prompt to enter the position for their respective key.

- The game continues until we have a winning combination or the grid is full and it is a draw.

- Winning combinations are full row, full column or full diagonal.
